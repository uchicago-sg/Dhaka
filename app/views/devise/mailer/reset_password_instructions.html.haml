%p Hi #{@resource.name},
%p Someone has requested a link to change your password, which you can do by #{link_to 'clicking this link', edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @resource.reset_password_token)}.
%p If you didn't request this, please ignore this email. Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.
%p Thanks,<br />Marketplace Team
